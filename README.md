# Arduino-to-serial-com
Simple program to communicate with from an Arduino to a Module through serial port

# Usage
 You just have to use a com port console (I'm using Termite) to send commands to the Arduino and it will redirect them to the plugged module. 
You can use the char '*' or '$' to increase or decrease the baud rate during communication
